#4.What does each method return in the following example?


arr = [15, 7, 18, 5, 12, 8, 5, 1]

1. arr.index(5) 
# This returns the 5th element in the array which is #5

2. arr.index[5]
# This returns an error as the [] signs were used instead of the () to search an array

3. arr[5]
# This command appears to search the index like example 1, although no index method was used and no ()?
